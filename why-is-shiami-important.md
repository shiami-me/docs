# Why is Shiami important?

### Problems that we solve

1.  Most of the DeFAI agents are still not easy to use as a total beginner.

    Solution - We focus on natural language commands more than anything else
2.  Sonic has a huge ecosystem but it is somewhat scattered.

    Solution - A platform that integrates major protocols on the Sonic network.
3. Our focus is not just DeFi, but it is also to provide a multi-utility solution to attract non-web3 users aswell.
