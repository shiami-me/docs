Get started by navigating to [shiami.me/chat](https://shiami.me/chat)

### Connect Wallet

Shiami uses Privy for managing wallet connections. You can get started by any of the login methods supported by Privy and an embedded wallet gets automatically created if you don't have one!

You can switch between Embedded wallet and Connected Wallet any time.
