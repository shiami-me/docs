2.  Navigate to the Create Agent page and create your agent workflow

    Example Workflow -

    1. Current Task - Send a price alert for EGGS token to chat@shiami.me everyday at 5pm
    2. Agents this would require - Scheduler, Price Agent, Email Formatting Agent(text), Email agent
3. After successful creation, you can view your agent under the Agent Workflows section.
