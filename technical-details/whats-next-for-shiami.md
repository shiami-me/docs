# What's next for Shiami?

### $SHIAMI token

We plan to launch $SHIAMI token.&#x20;

Our goal is to create a scalable architecture while incentivizing our users.&#x20;

Therefore, our users will soon be allowed to host shiami, through Libp2p which will help them earn $SHIAMI tokens.



### Just be in Sync with Sonic!

Sonic Ecosystem has been changing really quickly. So, for now, our goal is to keep up with their pace and integrate protocols into Shiami as soon as they are integrated in Sonic network

Next Up - AAVE and Rings Protocol



Stay tuned for more!
